This file is concerned with finding the alignment (position mapping) between the sequences
in the shape reactivity files (which are gapless) and the aligned sequences in Rfam (which
are the positions I use in the model). This is a first step in order to process the
reactivity profiles.

We here take care of aligning natural and synthetic sequences for the experiments carried
out in 2022.

MORE COMMENT I WROTE

Our first goal is to map positions in the probed sequences to the alignemd (match) positions of our model.
These sequences have been already aligned, but the SHAPE data files have lost the information about this alignment.
My goal here is to produce, for each probed aptamer, a list of positions that extract the match sites from the sequences in the SHAPE data files.

The SHAPE data files (see below) have the same sequences as the column `aptamers_df.sequence_tag_primer`.
These sequences include a tag+primer postfix (appended in the end), that we do not want to keep.
Having removed this postfix, the remaining prefix part should match the Rfam (or our designed) sequences.

# The idea is that natural_positions_mapping[n,j] will give the position of match column 'j'
# in the probed aptamer 'n' sequence (or `missing`, if this column is deleted (gap) for this aptamer!
# natural_positions_mapping is for the natural sequences.
# Synthetic sequences are easier (there are no inserts), and I will do a similar array below.
