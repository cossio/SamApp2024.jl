# Usage

The code is organized as a [Julia](https://julialang.org) package. After having installed Julia, clone this repository locally and activate the included `Project.toml`.

The included [Pluto notebooks](https://github.com/cossio/SamApp2024.jl/tree/main/pluto) contain the code for the downstream analysis done in the paper (which depend on the SamApp2024 package). For more information about Pluto notebooks, see: https://plutojl.org.

The code implementing Restricted Boltzmann machines (training, sampling, and other functions) is provided in a separate package: https://github.com/cossio/RestrictedBoltzmannMachines.jl. Note that this package will be installed automatically as a dependency of this repository by the Julia package manager.
