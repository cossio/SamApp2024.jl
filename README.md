If you use this code, please cite this paper (or you can use the included [CITATION.bib](https://github.com/cossio/SamApp2024.jl/blob/main/CITATION.bib)).

# Setup

The code is organized as a [Julia](https://julialang.org) package. If you haven't setup Julia on your computer, you can install it following the simple instructions from the [official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/). We have tested our package on the latest Julia version at the time of writing: `v1.10.4`. It should work on future `v1.x.y` versions of Julia as well.

After having installed Julia, clone this repository locally using `git`, on a local directory, by running the following command from the terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cossio/SamApp2024.jl.git
```

Then, activate the included `Project.toml`.

# Usage

The included [Pluto notebooks](https://github.com/cossio/SamApp2024.jl/tree/main/pluto) contain the code for the downstream analysis done in the paper (which depend on the `SamApp2024` package). For more information about Pluto notebooks, see: https://plutojl.org.

The code implementing Restricted Boltzmann machines (training, sampling, and other functions) is provided in a separate package: https://github.com/cossio/RestrictedBoltzmannMachines.jl. Note that this package will be installed automatically as a dependency of this repository by the Julia package manager.

# Issues
